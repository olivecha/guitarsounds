## guitarsounds

A python package to analyse guitar sounds. Developed as an educational analysis tool with the [Bruand Lutherie School](https://bruand.com/). 
The API documentation is available at [documentation](guitarsounds.readthedocs.io)

The current release contains usual signal processing tools applied to guitar sounds with automated figure generation trough `matplotlib` usable with a jupyter notebook GUI.

The analysis tools also feature a "frequency bin separation" tool where the sound is decomposed into 6 bins ("bass", "mid", "highmid", "uppermid", "presence" and "brillance"). This analysis should provide luthiers a more intuitional insight on how a guitar behave trough the frequency range, while retaining transient time information. 

## Installing the package

The `guitarsounds` package is installable trough `pip`:

```
pip install timbral_models
```
